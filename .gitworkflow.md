# Git Workflow Guide

## Branch Strategy

### Branches
- **`main`**: Production-ready code. Only merge here when code is tested and ready for deployment.
- **`develop`**: Development branch. All new features and fixes are developed here first.

## Workflow

### Daily Development
1. **Always work on `develop` branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Make your changes and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin develop
   ```

### Merging to Main (When Ready for Production)

1. **Ensure develop is up to date:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Switch to main and merge:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge develop
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Return to develop for continued work:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```

### Creating Feature Branches (Optional)

For larger features, you can create feature branches from develop:

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature-name
# Then merge back to develop when ready
```

## Current Setup

- ✅ `develop` branch created and pushed to remote
- ✅ Future development should happen on `develop`
- ✅ `main` branch is protected - only merge when code is production-ready

## Important Notes

- **Never commit directly to `main`** - always go through `develop` first
- **Test thoroughly on `develop`** before merging to `main`
- **Merge to `main`** only when you're ready to deploy to Streamlit Cloud
